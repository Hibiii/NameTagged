# Badge - Charcter map

The implementation of badges in this mod is that each badge is a character, and they are displayed in a special font.
Obviously, there's no trivial and easy way to keep code and resources in sync.
Therefore, each badge is given an exclusive Unicode character.

| Badge             | Code point | Ch | Description |
|:------------------|-----------:|:--:|-------------|
| Ears-enabled skin |    `U+0045`|  E | An orange animal ear |
